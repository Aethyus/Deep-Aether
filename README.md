# What is this about?

The Deep Aether is an addon for the Aether Mod for Minecraft for 1.19.4 and beyond.
It aims to add lots of new features to give players a chance to venture deeper into the Aether dimension, while also maintaining its original style.
Basically, we aim to give the Aether the "1.16 Nether Expansion Update" treatment.
 
 # What is new?

The Deep Aether mod introduces:
  - New Ores: such as Cloudium Debris and Skyjade Ore, both of which have armor and tool sets
      - Skyjade's ability is powerful upon first use, but gets less powerful the more durability is lost; basically the opposite of Zanite
      - Cloudium's ability is slow falling
  - New Armors And Tools
  - 5 new Biomes (for now): Aerglow Forest, Blue Aerglow Forest, Yagroot Swamp, Aerlavender Fields, and Golden Heights
  - New Music Discs
  - New Decorational Blocks, including 2 stone types, 4 trees, 3 wood sets, etc.
  - And more...

# Requirements

You'll need of course:
 - Forge
 - The Aether Mod (The 1.19.4 version)
